## Geospatial Data Analysis using Geopandas

I used Geopandas to plot geospatial data. Geopandas dataframes are similar to Pandas dataframes. Geopandas also allows you to create maps quickly and easily. Maps prepared in Python are easily reproducible and can be customized as per our needs. GeoPandas relies on Shapely to perform geometric operations, each country in our case will be encoded like a polygon using Shapely which will be used by Geopandas to plot.
I read the shape file to plot the countries on the world map and also read the csv file containing happiness ranks for all the countries to plot choropleth maps for Happiness Rank, Economic Development, Population Rank and Income Group.
